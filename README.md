# MIPS-pipeline
This is my Lab assignments for the course Computer Architecture, Zhejiang University. My course tutor is Jiang Xiaohong.

Finally we finish a pipeline CPU supporting stall, forwarding, predit-not-taken and interrupt.

### Lab1 Warm up
Extend single-cycle CPU(in Org) to run on Sword V4.


### Lab2 Basic pipeline 
5-stage pipelined CPU with 23 MIPS instructions. 

Execute program in pipeline correctly implementing "stall" when have hazards, using flushing approach to solve control hazard.
