# MIPS-pipeline
This is my Lab assignments for the course Computer Architecture, Zhejiang University. My course tutor is Jiang Xiaohong.

Finally we finish a pipeline CPU supporting 26 MIPS instructions, stall, forwarding, predit-not-taken and interrupt.

### Lab1 warm up
Extend single-cycle CPU(in Org) to run on Sword V4.
